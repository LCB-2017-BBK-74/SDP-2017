Facade design pattern description

The purpose of the facade design pattern is to hide the complexity of a system and its implementation details,
by providing a simpler interface to use to the client. This also helps to make the code more readable and to reduce the
dependencies of the outside code. It works as a wrapper around the system that is being simplified and can be used
in conjunction with some of the other design patterns mentioned previously.

The facade design pattern is useful when we want to hide the implementation details of many libraries, make an interface
much easier to use, and interact with complex systems.
