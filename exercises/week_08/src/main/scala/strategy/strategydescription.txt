Strategy design pattern - briefly describe the strategy design pattern, and explain when it's OK to use it

From Ivan Nikolov, Scala Design Patterns:

It is quite a common thing in enterprise applications to have different implementations of specific algorithms, and choosing
one to use while the application is running. Examples might include different sorting algorithms that would have different
performance for different sizes or types of data, different parsers for various possible representations of data, etc

The strategy design pattern enables us to define a family of algorithms or applications, and select a specific one at runtime.

The strategy design pattern also helps with encapsulation as each algorithm can be separately defined and then injected into
the classes that use it.
