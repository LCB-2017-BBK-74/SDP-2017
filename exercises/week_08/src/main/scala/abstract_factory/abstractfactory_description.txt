Q3 in the worksheet, Design Patterns II:

When is it appropriate to use the abstract factory design pattern?

The abstract factory has the same purpose as the factory design pattern. The purpose of using it is to encapsulate the
object creation logic and hide it from the user. The difference is in how it is implemented.

The abstract factory relies on object composition instead of inheritance, which is used by the factory method.
Here we have a separate object which provides an interface to create instances of the classes we need.
